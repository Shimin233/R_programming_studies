# R_programming_studies

I will follow an online course on Udemy, [R Programming A-Zâ„¢: R For Data Science With Real Exercises!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68281774/123816169-fe962180-d8ee-11eb-87f0-5106ac08eeb0.png), as well as other learning resources, to study R for data science. I am going to remark the sources respectively in the notes of their corresponding contents.
